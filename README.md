     - Implement a user feedback system.
     - Integrate a variety of products into the app
    - Enhance the checkout process for a smoother user experience.
    - Integrate additional payment plans for increased flexibility.

### Deployment 
Deployment was achieved through netlify which is the essential platform for the delivery of exceptional and dynamic web experiences, without limitations. There are two ways of deploying your app on netlify; you can either do it manually by drag and drop method or connect with your github repo. I used the latter as it ensures continuous deployment and changes made are implemented.
